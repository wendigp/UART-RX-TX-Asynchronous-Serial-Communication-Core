# UART-RX-TX-Asynchronous-Serial-Communication-Core
This project implements a UART RX-TX core in Verilog HDL for reliable asynchronous serial communication without a shared clock. It uses baud-rate based timing, center-bit sampling in RX, and tx_busy protection in TX. The modular, synthesizable design is verified using QuestaSim and VCS.
